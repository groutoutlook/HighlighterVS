## Highlighter

**Touch a bit for it to work with C/C++ files and CMakeLists.txt**
- You should clone this tree and build them to fetch the `.vsix`, and install them yourselves.

## Usage
- This extension will highlight a predefined set of keywords in comments such as:
  * TODO
  * BUG
  * NOTE 
  * DISCUSS
  * OPTIMIZE
  * FIXME
  * STEP
  * IMPORTANT
  * EXP
  * INFO
  * WARN
  * HACK
  * FIX

## Notes
- Also check out [QuadSpinner/Highlighter](https://github.com/QuadSpinner/Highlighter)
  - Pro: much more advanced highlight rules.
  - Cons: OOTB experience is not as good as this plugin, although this is a really crude one.
- Reason I considered forking this repo is the code's simplicity, it will be much easier porting to VS2026.
